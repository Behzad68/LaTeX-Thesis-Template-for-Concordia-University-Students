Degree Configuration \r\n![Degree Configuration](https://github.com/Tandysony/LaTeX-Thesis-Template-for-Concordia-University/blob/master/figures/DegreeInformation.png)\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\n In order to run it properly, you must have\r\n  * MikTex 2.9\r\n  * A LaTeX editor, e.g., TeXstudio, Texmaker, TeXnic, or TeXworks.\r\n  * The template `ConcordiaThesis.tex` and the style file `ConcordiaU.sty`.\r\n  * Internet connection if you are running it at your first time. You may need to download necessary package(s).\r\n\r\n## Troubleshooting\r\n  * The template has been tested with TeXstudio, TeXworks, CTex, and TeXnic under MikTex 2.9, with UTF-8 encoding. If you notice anything in the Thesis Specifications that does not match the templates, please let me know. I will make my effort to keep it up to date.           \r\n\r\n## FAQ\r\n * Q: Why I am getting question marks [?] for citations and references are not shown anymore?  \r\n\r\n A: Please (1). Make sure your bibiography file (.bib) is in the folder and each item is configured correctly (pay attention to `,` and `}`. (2). Run in this sequence: `pdfLaTex` -->  `bibTex` --> `pdfLaTex`.  It may help.\r\n\r\n## Contact\r\n* Suo Tan - [tandysony@gmail.com](tandysony@gmail.com)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
