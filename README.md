## Introduction
 This thesis template has been created to make it easy to prepare your thesis using LaTeX while adhering to the [Concordia University Thesis Specifications posted online](https://www.concordia.ca/artsci/english/programs/graduate/english-ma/thesis-deadlines-formatting.html#format). The official thesis examples are provided here as a PDF file: http://www.concordia.ca/content/dam/concordia/offices/sgs/docs/handbooks/thesispreparationguide.pdf. Please refer to the last few pages for the thesis example.

## Requirements
 To start with
  * MikTex 2.9
  * A LaTeX editor, e.g., TeXstudio, Texmaker, TeXnic, or TeXworks.
  * The template `ConcordiaThesis.tex` and the style file `ConcordiaU.sty`.
  * Internet connection if you are running it at your first time. You may need to download necessary package(s).

## Troubleshooting
  * The template has been tested with TeXstudio, TeXworks, CTex, and TeXnic under MikTex 2.9, with UTF-8 encoding. If you notice anything in the Thesis Specifications that does not match the templates, please let me know. I will make my effort to keep it up to date.           

## FAQ
 * Q: Why I am getting question marks [?] for citations and references are not shown anymore?  

 A: Please (1). Make sure you bibiography file (.bib) is in the folder and each items are formed correctly (pay attention to `,` and `}`. (2). Run in this sequence: `pdfLaTex` -->  `bibTex` --> `pdfLaTex`.  This may help.
